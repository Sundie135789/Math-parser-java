This Math Parser is kinda useful.. sometimes;
All you gotta do is just type expression in the area and press Submit
make sure to have a space bar after each number and operator
even the last one, have a space after it, or else computer go boom boom
example: 25 + 32 / 12 - 2 ;
supported operators: + - * /
